# Ebook Discovery Skill: Design Notes

**Purpose:** Capture the design thinking from our conversation so this skill can be built in a future session.

**Date:** December 30, 2024

## What This Skill Does

Surface ebook ideas you didn't know you had. This is the optional "upstream" skill that feeds into Ebook Concept Development.

**Key distinction:** This is divergent/generative ("what's here?") while Concept Development is convergent/evaluative ("is this right and ready?").

---

## Entry Modes

The skill should support multiple ways of discovering ebook candidates:

### 1. Content Audit

- What's hiding in existing YouTube videos, newsletters, blog posts
- Look for clusters, patterns, recurring themes
- What content has performed well (views, engagement, comments)?
- What questions do people ask in response to content?

### 2. Book Extraction

- What sections from larger book projects could stand alone as ebooks?
- Strategic extraction: test interest, generate revenue while big book develops
- Which piece to extract first, and why?

### 3. Zettelkasten Mining

- Clusters of connected notes that reveal ebook-shaped ideas
- Themes that keep emerging in permanent notes
- Different from published content — this is the thinking archive

### 4. Parking Lot Review

- Ideas parked during other brainstorming sessions
- Things that didn't fit larger projects but could stand alone
- Cross-project intersection points (where two ideas overlap)

### 5. Expertise Extraction

- Tacit knowledge the author doesn't recognize as valuable
- Things that feel "obvious" to you but aren't to others
- What do people ask you repeatedly?
- What process have you refined that others struggle with?

### 6. Repeated Questions Analysis

- YouTube comments asking the same thing
- Email replies with common themes
- Questions after talks or teaching
- What do people assume you have the answer to?

### 7. Failed Project Resurrection

- Abandoned drafts, half-written posts, stalled projects
- Sometimes projects fail because of wrong FORMAT, not wrong idea
- What could be revived as an ebook?

### 8. Contrarian Positions

- Views that push against mainstream thinking
- Even against mainstream thinking in your own circles
- "What do I believe that most people get wrong?"
- Contrarian stances have built-in tension — good for ebooks

### 9. Translation Bridges

- Things you explain between worlds you inhabit (e.g., technology ↔ theology)
- What do you explain to one group about another group's domain?
- These bridges might be ebooks

### 10. Personal Systems

- Workflows and processes you've developed
- Spiritual disciplines, reading rhythms, decision-making frameworks
- Lived systems are often more valuable than theoretical ones

### 11. Additional Sources

- Book marginalia and reading responses (reactions to other books)
- Unpublished lengthy responses (long emails, detailed comments)
- "I wish this book existed" frustrations (gaps you've experienced)
- Mistakes and hard lessons (failure-earned wisdom)

---

## Output

A curated list of ebook candidates, each with:

- Brief description of the idea
- Source/origin (which entry mode surfaced it)
- Initial viability notes (why it might work, concerns)
- Validation signals (if any exist — views, questions, engagement)
- Recommended next step (develop further, park, kill, needs research)

This output then feeds into Ebook Concept Development for the ideas worth pursuing.

## Key Behaviors

### Ebook-Specific Pressure Throughout

- **Format-fit calibration** — Is this genuinely ebook-sized?
- **"One problem, one solution" test** — Can this be stated tightly?
- **Transformation sizing** — Is the transformation ebook-appropriate?
- **Unique mechanism discovery** — Is there a nameable framework or method?

### Collaboration Style

Same as Concept Development:

- Genuine intellectual partnership
- Push back with reasoning
- One question at a time
- Contribute ideas proactively

### Audience Validation Awareness

Unlike traditional authors, creators have audiences to test ideas with:

- Which ideas could be polled with newsletter readers?
- What YouTube comment questions keep appearing?
- Existing audience is a signal — use it

### Timeliness/Moment Awareness

- Is there a moment for any of these ideas?
- Is something timely right now?
- Ebooks can move fast — can ride waves that books can't

### Series Potential

- Notice when an idea is really multiple related ebooks
- The first one might be a wedge into a larger offering

---

## Session Flow Considerations

### Starting the Session

- Ask which entry mode(s) the user wants to explore
- Could work through one mode deeply or scan across several
- User might bring specific content to audit, or start blank

### During Discovery

- Generate candidates, don't just facilitate
- "Based on what you've described, I see three potential ebooks hiding here..."
- Challenge weak candidates early
- Notice patterns across modes

### Ending the Session

- Produce the candidate list with viability notes
- Recommend which candidates are worth developing
- Clear handoff to Concept Development for chosen idea(s)

---

## Multi-Session Considerations

Discovery might span multiple sessions:

- Content audit could be substantial
- Mining Zettelkasten takes time
- User might want to gather information between sessions

Need a working document that tracks:

- Which entry modes have been explored
- Candidates surfaced (with notes)
- What's still to explore

---

## Relationship to Other Skills

**Upstream:** None required (this is an entry point)

**Downstream:** Ebook Concept Development

- Discovery surfaces candidates
- User picks one (or more) to develop
- Concept Development takes it from there

**Parallel:** Generic brainstorm skill

- Discovery is ebook-specific
- Generic brainstorm is for any creative/analytical challenge
- User could use generic brainstorm first, then Discovery to find ebook candidates in the output

## Open Questions for Build Session

1. **How structured should the entry modes be?** Menu to choose from, or more fluid exploration?

2. **How much should Claude lead vs. follow?** In Concept Development, user brings an idea. In Discovery, should Claude more actively suggest "let's try X mode"?

3. **What's the document structure?** Similar living document approach, or something lighter since this is more exploratory?

4. **How do we handle "too many candidates"?** If Discovery surfaces 15 potential ebooks, how do we help prioritize?

5. **Should there be a "quick scan" mode?** Fast pass across all entry modes vs. deep dive into one?

---

## Reference Files to Consider

- **Entry mode guide** — Detailed prompts/questions for each mode
- **Viability quick-check** — What makes a candidate worth developing
- **Example candidate assessments** — Good/weak candidates with reasoning

## Notes from Conversation

Robert's specific context that shaped this skill:

- Has YouTube videos, newsletter articles, blog posts to potentially repurpose
- Has larger book ideas (200+ pages) that could have sections extracted
- Uses Zettelkasten method — has a thinking archive to mine
- Has expertise in both technology and theology (translation bridge)
- Values discovering ideas he didn't know he had, not just evaluating known ideas

The skill should help him see what's already there, not just process what he brings.
