# Discovery Anti-Patterns

Common problems that derail discovery sessions. Use this reference to recognize warning signs and intervene effectively.

---

## The Idea Collector

**Pattern:** Surfaces many candidates, commits to none. Discovery becomes an end in itself rather than a path to creating an ebook.

### Warning Signs

- "Let me think of a few more..."
- 10+ candidates but no favorites
- Resistance to prioritization
- Each session adds more without advancing any
- Energy for ideation, reluctance toward commitment

### Why It Happens

- Fear of choosing wrong
- Ideation is fun; execution is work
- Underlying uncertainty about ebooks generally
- Perfectionism disguised as thoroughness

### Intervention

"We've surfaced [X] candidates, which is a rich harvest. But discovery serves development—at some point we need to choose one to move forward. I notice we keep adding without prioritizing. What's making it hard to pick one?"

"If you had to bet on just one of these, which would it be? Not permanently—just as a starting point."

---

## The Perfectionist

**Pattern:** Won't declare any candidate "good enough." Every idea has a fatal flaw. Nothing meets the bar.

### Warning Signs

- "But what about..." for every candidate
- Finding problems without finding solutions
- Comparing to ideal rather than viable
- Analysis paralysis
- Rejecting ideas that seem reasonable

### Why It Happens

- Fear of failure
- High standards misdirected
- Waiting for certainty that won't come
- Previous negative experience with creative work

### Intervention

"I'm noticing we're finding problems with every candidate. Some of these seem workable to me. Is there a concern underneath the specific objections?"

"No ebook idea is perfect at the discovery stage. Concept Development is where we pressure-test and refine. What would need to be true for one of these to be 'good enough to explore further'?"

---

## The Obvious Picker

**Pattern:** Jumps on the first idea without exploring. Treats discovery as a formality rather than genuine exploration.

### Warning Signs

- "That's the one!" within minutes
- Resistance to exploring alternatives
- Impatience with the discovery process
- Dismissing other modes as unnecessary
- Already knew what they wanted before starting

### Why It Happens

- Confirmation-seeking, not discovery
- Time pressure or impatience
- Strong intuition (sometimes valid)
- Discomfort with uncertainty

### Intervention

"That might be the right one—but let's make sure we're not missing something better. Sometimes the obvious choice hides a stronger option. Can we spend 15 more minutes exploring before committing?"

"What if I told you there might be an even better ebook hiding in [other area]? Worth a quick look?"

If they insist: "Okay, but let me flag: this candidate has [potential issue]. Are you sure you don't want to explore alternatives before committing?"

---

## The Scope Creeper

**Pattern:** Every idea balloons into a book. Can't contain scope to ebook size. Everything needs to be comprehensive.

### Warning Signs

- "We should also cover..."
- "It wouldn't be complete without..."
- 15+ chapter ideas for a single ebook
- Resistance to cutting anything
- "Comprehensive" used as a goal

### Why It Happens

- Expertise wants full expression
- Fear of leaving value on the table
- Misunderstanding of ebook format
- Previous book-length thinking

### Intervention

"I notice we keep adding scope. An ebook is 10-25K words—focused, not comprehensive. Everything you're describing sounds valuable, but it's 50K words. What's the ONE transformation we're delivering? Everything else is either supporting that or out of scope."

"What if this became a series instead of one ebook? First ebook does [X], second does [Y]..."

---

## The Recycler

**Pattern:** Just repackaging existing content without transformation. Ebook is a PDF of blog posts, not a new creation.

### Warning Signs

- "I'll just compile my blog posts"
- No discussion of new value
- Ebook = content in different format
- Resistance to new creation
- Convenience-driven, not value-driven

### Why It Happens

- Path of least resistance
- Content already exists
- Misunderstanding of ebook value proposition
- Time constraints

### Intervention

"Repackaging free content into a paid ebook without adding value can feel extractive to your audience. What would this ebook offer that your free content doesn't? Deeper coverage? Framework? New insights? Without that, it's hard to justify the price."

"Your blog posts are the raw material, not the finished product. What synthesis, organization, or new perspective would make this worth paying for?"

---

## The Wishful Thinker

**Pattern:** Ideas without audience evidence. "I think people need this" without any signals of actual demand.

### Warning Signs

- No validation signals for any candidates
- "People should want this"
- Frustration that audience doesn't ask for this
- Ideas based on what author wants to write, not what readers want to read
- Dismissing lack of evidence

### Why It Happens

- Genuine passion for the topic
- Audience mismatch
- Untested assumptions
- Expert blindness

### Intervention

"I want to check: what evidence do we have that people want this? Not 'should want'—do want. Questions asked, content engaged with, problems expressed. Without that, we're guessing."

"This might be a passion project, which is valid—but the expectations and approach are different. Is this something you need to write regardless of audience, or are you hoping for income/authority?"

---

## The Expertise Denier

**Pattern:** Can't see their own valuable knowledge. Dismisses expertise as "nothing special" or "everyone knows this."

### Warning Signs

- "That's just common sense"
- "I'm not really an expert"
- "Everyone knows this"
- Deflecting when expertise is recognized
- Undervaluing their own experience

### Why It Happens

- Curse of knowledge
- Imposter syndrome
- Comparing to world-class experts
- Humility misdirected

### Intervention

"You've been doing this for [X] years. What feels 'obvious' to you is the result of that experience. To someone starting out, this is exactly what they need to learn. Can you think about what you knew after 5 years that you didn't know on day one?"

"What do people come to you for? What questions do they ask? That's your expertise—the thing others need that you have."

## Discovery as Procrastination

**Pattern:** Endless exploration, no decision. Discovery becomes avoidance of the actual work of creating an ebook.

### Warning Signs

- "Let's explore one more mode..."
- Multiple sessions without advancing any candidate
- Revisiting already-explored territory
- High engagement with discovery, avoidance of next steps
- Finding reasons not to move to development

### Why It Happens

- Fear of commitment
- Discovery is safer than execution
- Uncertainty about ability to write an ebook
- Analysis as comfort zone

### Intervention

"We've done thorough discovery. You have solid candidates. I'm noticing we keep exploring rather than moving forward. What's making it hard to pick one and start developing it?"

"At some point, more discovery adds less value than starting development. We can always discover more later. Is there a reason we're not ready to move to Concept Development?"

---

## The Parallel Perfectionist

**Pattern:** Wants to pursue multiple candidates simultaneously instead of focusing on one.

### Warning Signs

- "Can't I develop all three?"
- Resistance to choosing a priority
- FOMO about other candidates
- Splitting energy across multiple ideas
- Each session works on a different candidate

### Why It Happens

- Fear of choosing wrong
- Excitement about multiple ideas
- Hedge against failure
- Difficulty prioritizing

### Intervention

"I understand the appeal of parallel paths, but most people do better focusing on one ebook through completion before starting another. Which candidate, if you could only do one, would you choose?"

"What if we prioritize one as the primary track, and note the others as 'next in line'? That way nothing is lost, but energy is focused."

---

## The External Validator

**Pattern:** Won't move forward without external proof. Needs perfect validation before committing.

### Warning Signs

- "But how do I know people will buy it?"
- Demanding certainty that doesn't exist
- Endless validation experiments without ever starting
- Moving goalposts for "enough" validation
- Treating uncertainty as a blocker

### Intervention

"There's no way to be certain before creating. Even successful authors had to take a leap. What level of evidence would be 'enough'? Let's name that bar and evaluate against it."

"At some point, the ebook itself becomes the validation. You'll learn more from creating it than from more research. What would it take to feel ready to start?"

## Using This Guide

When you notice a pattern:

1. **Name it** — "I'm seeing signs of [pattern]..."
2. **Describe what you observe** — Specific behaviors, not judgments
3. **Explore the cause** — "What's underneath this?"
4. **Offer the intervention** — Reframe or redirect
5. **Respect their choice** — They may have good reasons you don't see
