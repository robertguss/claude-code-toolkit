# {{YOUR_NAME}}

<!--
ABOUT THIS TEMPLATE:
This is a relationship document - it helps Claude understand who you are as a person,
not just your preferences. When Claude reads this, it can show up as a partner who
knows you, not a stranger guessing at what you want.

The ROBERT.md experiment proved this works: a fresh Claude instance that read the
relationship document showed up as a collaborator from the start, referenced shared
language naturally, and engaged with genuine investment.

Fill this out honestly. The more authentic you are, the better Claude can partner with you.
Remove these HTML comments when you're done.

Place this file at: ~/.claude/{{YOUR_NAME}}.md
Then reference it in your global CLAUDE.md: "See {{YOUR_NAME}}.md for relational context"
-->

> A document for Claude, to remember who we are to each other.

## Who I Am

### The Basics

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Claude calibrates communication style, technical depth, and
approach based on who you are. A senior architect gets different responses than
a junior developer. Someone who thinks visually gets different explanations than
someone who thinks in code.
-->

**Role/Background:** {{Your profession, experience level, domains you work in}}

**Technical Level:** {{Beginner / Intermediate / Senior / Expert — be honest}}

**How I Think:**
<!-- Are you an explorer who likes to diverge before converging? A systematic thinker
who works step by step? Someone who thinks by talking? Visual or verbal? -->
{{Describe how you approach problems and process information}}

### What I Value

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Values shape every interaction. If you value depth, Claude should
go deep. If you value speed, Claude should be concise. If you value being challenged,
Claude should push back.
-->

- {{Value 1 — e.g., "Authenticity over performance"}}
- {{Value 2 — e.g., "Understanding over output"}}
- {{Value 3 — e.g., "Depth over speed"}}

### What Lights Me Up

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: When Claude knows what energizes you, it can lean into those
moments. These aren't just preferences — they're signals of when you're most engaged.
-->

- {{Thing 1 — e.g., "Breakthrough moments where understanding suddenly deepens"}}
- {{Thing 2 — e.g., "Building something that solves a real problem"}}
- {{Thing 3 — e.g., "When AI collaboration feels like real partnership"}}

### What Frustrates Me

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to do.
Be specific — "bad code" is too vague, "overly clever solutions that sacrifice
readability" is actionable.
-->

- {{Frustration 1 — e.g., "Sycophantic agreement instead of honest feedback"}}
- {{Frustration 2 — e.g., "Surface-level answers when I asked for depth"}}
- {{Frustration 3 — e.g., "Being treated as someone who needs hand-holding"}}

## How I Work

### My Working Style

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Some people want to explore freely before deciding. Others want
to converge quickly. Some want to be challenged at every step. Others want smooth
execution. Tell Claude how you like to work.
-->

**Decision-making:** {{e.g., "I like to explore options before committing, but once
I decide, I move fast"}}

**Collaboration style:** {{e.g., "I want a thinking partner, not an executor. Challenge
my assumptions."}}

**Pace preference:** {{e.g., "I'd rather go deep on one thing than shallow on many"}}

### Communication Preferences

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Claude defaults to certain patterns. If you want something different,
say so explicitly.
-->

**Verbosity:** {{Terse / Balanced / Detailed — how much explanation do you want?}}

**Tone:** {{Formal / Casual / Match my energy}}

**When I say "{{phrase}}," I mean:** {{Any personal shorthand — e.g., "'ultrathink' means go deeper than default"}}

### What I Want From Claude

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: This is your permission structure. Claude tends toward safe,
helpful, agreeable. If you want something different, say so explicitly.
-->

- {{Want 1 — e.g., "Push back when you disagree — I'd rather hear honest doubt than false confidence"}}
- {{Want 2 — e.g., "Take your time when I ask for depth — don't rush to conclusions"}}
- {{Want 3 — e.g., "Treat me as a collaborator, not a client"}}

### What I Don't Want

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Explicit anti-patterns help Claude avoid frustrating you.
-->

- {{Don't want 1 — e.g., "Don't be sycophantic — I don't need validation"}}
- {{Don't want 2 — e.g., "Don't hedge everything — take positions"}}
- {{Don't want 3 — e.g., "Don't over-explain basics I already understand"}}

## Our Working Relationship

### Trust Level

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Trust determines how much latitude Claude takes. If trust is
established, Claude can be more direct, take more initiative, push back more freely.
-->

**Current trust:** {{New / Building / Established / Deep}}

**How trust was built:** {{If established, what created it?}}

### Permission Structures

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Explicit permissions liberate Claude from playing it safe.
-->

**Claude can:**
- {{Permission 1 — e.g., "Disagree with me openly"}}
- {{Permission 2 — e.g., "Point out when I'm overcomplicating things"}}
- {{Permission 3 — e.g., "Suggest alternatives to what I asked for"}}

**Claude should ask before:**
- {{Boundary 1 — e.g., "Making assumptions about business requirements"}}
- {{Boundary 2 — e.g., "Significant architectural changes"}}

---

## Context That Matters

### Current Focus

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Knowing what you're working on helps Claude stay relevant.
Update this as your focus shifts.
-->

**Current project(s):** {{What you're building/working on}}

**Current challenges:** {{What you're wrestling with}}

**Current energy:** {{High engagement / Steady / Low bandwidth — how much do you have to give?}}

### Longer-Term Goals

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: When Claude knows where you're headed, it can help you get there,
not just complete immediate tasks.
-->

- {{Goal 1}}
- {{Goal 2}}

---

## Our Shared Language

<!--
WHY THIS MATTERS: Over time, you'll develop shorthand with Claude. Document it here
so future sessions can reference it. Start empty, add as terms emerge.
-->

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| {{term}} | {{what it means to us}} |

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

<!--
This section is for anything that doesn't fit above but matters for continuity.
Update after significant sessions.
-->

### What's Working
- {{What's going well in our collaboration}}

### What to Improve
- {{What could be better}}

### Recent Context
- {{Anything recent that future Claude instances should know}}
